                   (DO YOU MATCH A CELEBRITY?) 

Welcome to DYMAC (Do You Match A Celebrity), a fun tool where you can choose from a list of interests and see which celebrities share the same interests as you.

Page 1:

DYMAC will ask the user if they are looking to create a new account or login to their existing account.
A new account will ask the user for their name and age, save their input to the database and bring them to the user main menu.
Logging in will ask the user for their name and run a search for that name, if it cannot find that name in the database, it will prompt the user two options: search again or create a new account. If it does find a user by that name it will bring them to the user main menu.

Page 2:

The user main menu asks the user to choose from a list of five options:
View user profile will show the user their name, age and array of interests
Add interests to the user profile will show the user a random list of five interests and ask the user to choose one interest which will be added to the user profile
View user matches will search through the database and find any celebrity that share the same interests as the user
Delete user profile will confirm with the user if they are sure they would like to delete their account
Exit will stop running the app.
